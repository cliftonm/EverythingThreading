<p>Everything Threading</p>
<p>Various approaches to threading and discussing of locks, semaphores, 
concurrent collections, work queues, and thread joining</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I was recently asked to provide some training on how threads are used in C#.&nbsp; 
What started off as simple (doesn't it always) turned into a detailed analysis 
of different approaches to threading and various ancillary topics.&nbsp; While 
this is all been discussed before, I'm not sure there exists a comprehensive 
look at threading, which hopefully this article succinctly covers.</p>
<h3>Coming Up With a Good Thread Example</h3>
<p>The first problem of course is coming up with a good example where the work 
is capable of being broken up into isolated chunks and that takes a reasonable 
amount of computational time so you can really see the difference in approaches.&nbsp; 
I chose a brute force &quot;is the number prime&quot; algorithm.&nbsp; And I truly mean 
brute force:</p>
<pre>static bool IsPrime(int n)
{
  bool ret = true;
  for (int i = 2; i &lt;= n / 2 &amp;&amp; ret; ret = n % i++ != 0);
  return ret;
}</pre>
<p>Yes, there actually is no content to the for loop -- it does end in a <code>;</code>.</p>
<p>Obviously, you would NEVER write a prime number calculation this way (a much 
better approach is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of 
Eranthoses</a>, which I'll actually work with 
later in this article) but this algorithm has the advantage of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Being slow.</li>
	<li>Returning a true/false for each number.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an advantage when writing an article about the nuances of threads!</p>
<h3>The Timing Algorithm</h3>
<p>To time things, I wrote a simple &quot;time how long this function takes&quot;:</p>
<pre>static void DurationOf(Func&lt;int&gt; action, string section)
{
  var start = DateTime.Now;
  int numPrimes = action();
  var stop = DateTime.Now;

  lock (locker)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(section);
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Number of primes is : &quot; + numPrimes);
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Total seconds = &quot; + (stop - start).TotalSeconds);
  }
}</pre>
<p>It's rather tailored to the examples here in this article.</p>
<h3>Locks</h3>
<p>Let's talk about locks right now.&nbsp; Notice in the above code the <code>lock</code> 
statement.&nbsp; The <code>lock</code> ensures that each <code>Console.WriteLine</code> is not 
&quot;interrupted&quot; by another thread also writing to the console.&nbsp; A 
lock statement requires an <code>object</code> that all threads can access which acts as the 
synchronization object between threads.&nbsp; Typically, the synchronization 
object is a root level <code>Object</code>:</p>
<pre>static object locker = new object();</pre>
<p align="f">Historically, the concept of a lock was called a &quot;critical 
section&quot;, meaning that only one thread could enter the code at a time.&nbsp; 
Native Windows programmers will be familiar with the CRITICAL_SECTION<sup>4</sup> 
structure and related methods.</p>
<p>Locks can be dangerous:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If what you're performing in the lock takes a long time, your thread 
	will lose performance as it waits for the lock to be released by another 
	thread.</li>
	<li>It's fairly easy to create a deadlock in which thread A is waiting for 
	the lock to be released, and thread B, currently inside the lock, is waiting 
	for thread A to finish some task.</li>
</ul>
<p>The body of a lock statement should never include anything that waits for a 
thread to do some work.&nbsp; However, locks are useful when doing simple 
synchronization, particularly of debug output or synchronizing access to a 
physical &quot;thing&quot; like a hardware port.&nbsp; Otherwise, if there's a <code>lock</code> in 
your code, it's probably a big red flag.</p>
<h3>A Helper Method for the Brute Force Algorithm</h3>
<p>This is called by several of the variations of brute force algorithm that are 
to demonstrate threading, so it's useful to implement it once.</p>
<pre>static int NumPrimes(int start, int end)
{
  int numPrimes = 0;
  for (int i = start; i &lt; end; numPrimes += IsPrime(i++) ? 1 : 0);
  return numPrimes;
}</pre>
<p>Yeah, another one of those do-nothing loops where the work is done in the 
iterator portion of the for loop. </p>
<h2>Brute Force Algorithm</h2>
<p>Here we want to find how many primes there are between 2 and 500,000.&nbsp; I 
chose 500,000 as the maximum as it takes about 35 seconds on my machine to 
determine that there are 41,538 prime numbers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Calling the algorithm:</p>
<pre>DurationOf(BruteForce, &quot;Brute force:&quot;);</pre>
<p>The implementation:</p>
<pre>static int BruteForce()
{
  int numPrimes = NumPrimes(2, MAX);

  return numPrimes;
}
</pre>
<p>The results:</p>
<pre>Brute force:
Number of primes is : 41538
Total seconds = 30.1119874</pre>
<h2>Threaded The Brute Force Algorithm</h2>
<p>Let's take a stab at optimizing this by breaking the work up into chunks and 
giving each thread (up to the number of processors) the chunk to work on.&nbsp; 
We'll evenly divide the chunks.&nbsp; The astute reader will realize that is not 
optimal, but we'll illustrate why and discuss one of the important things about 
multi-threading -- make sure your work load is evenly distributed!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that what I'm about to show you is rather old school!</p>
<p>Calling the algorithm:</p>
<pre>DurationOf(ThreadedBruteForce, &quot;Threaded brute force:&quot;);</pre>
<p>The implementation:</p>
<p>First, setting up the threads:</p>
<pre>static int ThreadedBruteForce()
{
  List&lt;(Thread thread, int threadNum, int start, int end)&gt; threads = new List&lt;(Thread thread, int threadNum, int start, int end)&gt;();

  int numProcs = Environment.ProcessorCount;

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; numProcs; i++)
  {
    int start = Math.Max(1, i * (MAX / numProcs)) + 1;
    int end = (i + 1) * (MAX / numProcs);
    var thread = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(BruteForceThread));
    thread.IsBackground = true;
    threads.Add((thread, i, start, end));
  }

  totalNumPrimes = 0;
  threads.ForEach(t =&gt; t.thread.Start((t.threadNum, t.start, t.end)));
  threads.ForEach(t =&gt; t.thread.Join());

  return totalNumPrimes;
}</pre>
<p>The worker thread:</p>
<pre>static void BruteForceThread(object parms)
{
  (int threadNum, int start, int end) parm = (ValueTuple&lt;int, int, int&gt;)parms;
  DurationOf(() =&gt;
  {
    int numPrimes = NumPrimes(parm.start, parm.end);
    Interlocked.Add(ref totalNumPrimes, numPrimes);
    return numPrimes;
  }, $&quot;Thread {parm.threadNum} processing {parm.start} to {parm.end}&quot;);
}</pre>
<p>The results:</p>
<pre>Thread 0 processing 2 to 125000
Number of primes is : 11734
Total seconds = 3.8519907
Thread 1 processing 125001 to 250000
Number of primes is : 10310
Total seconds = 9.0879819
Thread 2 processing 250001 to 375000
Number of primes is : 9860
Total seconds = 12.963975
Thread 3 processing 375001 to 500000
Number of primes is : 9634
Total seconds = 16.4079704
Threaded brute force:
Number of primes is : 41538
Total seconds = 16.4119713</pre>
<p>OK, cool, we've taken a 35 second process and reduced it to 16 seconds.&nbsp; 
But notice that the workload is not evenly distributed.&nbsp; The threads take 
different times.&nbsp; The reason should be obvious -- the larger the number 
we're trying to determine is prime or not, the more divisions need to be 
executed.&nbsp; So for numbers at the lower range, the thread finishes faster:</p>
<pre>Thread 0 processing 2 to 125000
Number of primes is : 11734
Total seconds = 3.8519907</pre>
<p>vs:</p>
<pre>Thread 3 processing 375001 to 500000
Number of primes is : 9634
Total seconds = 16.4079704</pre>
<h3>Thread Joins</h3>
<p>Notice once the threads have been started, there is this statement:</p>
<pre>threads.ForEach(t =&gt; t.thread.Join());</pre>
<p>Here the Join method suspends execution until the thread on which Join is 
called has finished.&nbsp; Be aware:</p>
<ul>
	<li>This can cause the current thread to indefinitely suspend its operation.</li>
	<li>You wouldn't do this on a UI thread as the UI will no longer respond to 
	user actions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Background Threads</h3>
<p>Notice this statement:</p>
<pre>thread.IsBackground = true;</pre>
<p>Telling the thread that it is a background thread ensures that it is killed 
when the application exits.&nbsp; If you have a thread that is not a background 
thread and you close the application or it in some other way terminates, the 
thread will continue to exist (and run) as a process.</p>
<h3>Thread Parameters</h3>
<p>Notice this statement:</p>
<pre>var thread = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(BruteForceThread));</pre>
<p>Here we are setting up the method that implements the thread to accept 
parameters.&nbsp; The signature must be <code>[methodName](object parameters)</code>, 
which requires that you cast the object to the same type being passed in when 
the thread is started:</p>
<p>Starting the thread (I'm using a value tuple as the parameter):</p>
<pre>threads.ForEach(t =&gt; t.thread.Start((t.threadNum, t.start, t.end)));</pre>
<p>Casting the object (a value tuple in this case) in the method implementing 
the thread:</p>
<pre>(int threadNum, int start, int end) parm = (ValueTuple&lt;int, int, int&gt;)parms;</pre>
<h3>Avoiding Casting the Object Parameter With a Lambda Expression</h3>
<p>You can avoid the cast using an lambda expression which provides closure for 
the current parameter values, like this:</p>
<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; numProcs; i++)
{
  int j = i;
  int start = Math.Max(1, i * (MAX / numProcs)) + 1;
  int end = (i + 1) * (MAX / numProcs);
  var thread = new Thread(() =&gt; BruteForceThread(j, start, end));
  thread.IsBackground = true;
  threads.Add((thread, i, start, end));
}</pre>
<p>Notice&nbsp;<code>int j = i;</code> is required for the closure -- otherwise 
the thread number (not to be confused with the thread ID) is always the number 
of processors (4 in my examples, usually.)</p>
<p>Also notice that this works but is not necessary:</p>
<pre>var thread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(() =&gt; BruteForceThread(j, start, end)));</pre>
<p>Why?&nbsp; Because <code>ThreadStart</code> is defined as a delegate: <code>public delegate void ThreadStart();</code>so a 
lambda expression is perfectly valid.</p>
<p>The method implementing the thread now can accept parameters in the method 
signature, avoiding the cast:</p>
<pre>static void BruteForceThread(int threadNum, int start, int end)</pre>
<h3>Using the ThreadStart Delegate is Time Costly!</h3>
<p>These two lines of code are NOT equivalent:</p>
<pre>var thread = new Thread(() =&gt; BruteForceThread(j, start, end));</pre>
<p>vs.</p>
<pre>var thread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(() =&gt; BruteForceThread(j, start, end)));</pre>
<p>Notice the timing difference in the second version:</p>
<pre>Thread 0 processing 2 to 125000
Number of primes is : 11734
Total seconds = 4.3607559
Thread 1 processing 125001 to 250000
Number of primes is : 10310
Total seconds = 10.5416041
Thread 2 processing 250001 to 375000
Number of primes is : 9860
Total seconds = 14.9788427
Thread 3 processing 375001 to 500000
Number of primes is : 9634
Total seconds = 19.2458287
Threaded brute force:
Number of primes is : 41538
Total seconds = 19.2458287</pre>
<p>Roughly: </p>
<ul>
	<li>thread 0 take .5 seconds longer</li>
	<li>thread 1 and 2 take 1.5 seconds longer</li>
	<li>thread 3 takes almost 3 seconds longer</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't just an anomaly, this is a consistent repeatable difference.&nbsp; 
I have not found any discussion of why this is the case.</p>
<h2>Balancing the Brute Force Algorithm Threads</h2>
<p>Notice that the worker threads are not very balanced -- the work load <i>
looks</i> like it is evenly distributed because we're giving each thread 1/n<sup>th</sup> 
(where n is the number of processors) of the work, but due to the nature of the 
work, CPU cores are not efficiently used -- the thread with the lowest number 
range finishes much sooner than the thread with the highest number range.</p>
<h3>Asking for Work vs. Telling the Thread What Work to Do</h3>
<p>A clue as to whether your threads are optimized is this: are you telling your 
threads what work to do, or are your threads requesting work?&nbsp; In the 
threaded brute force algorithm above, we are <i>telling</i> the thread what work 
it should be doing.&nbsp; In this next iteration, the thread will be <i>asking</i> 
for work when it is available.</p>
<p>Calling the algorithm</p>
<pre>DurationOf(ThreadedGetNextWorkItemBruteForce, &quot;Threaded get next work item brute force:&quot;);</pre>
<p>The implementation:</p>
<pre>static int ThreadedGetNextWorkItemBruteForce()
{
  List&lt;(Thread thread, int threadNum)&gt; threads = new List&lt;(Thread thread, int threadNum)&gt;();
  int numProcs = Environment.ProcessorCount;

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; numProcs; i++)
  {
    var thread = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(NextWorkItemBruteForceThread));
    thread.IsBackground = true;
    threads.Add((thread, i));
  }

  totalNumPrimes = 0;
  nextNumber = 1;
  threads.ForEach(t =&gt; t.thread.Start(t.threadNum));
  threads.ForEach(t =&gt; t.thread.Join());

  return totalNumPrimes;
}</pre>
<p>The worker thread:</p>
<pre>static void NextWorkItemBruteForceThread(object parms)
{
  int threadNum = (int)parms;
  DurationOf(() =&gt;
  {
    int numPrimes = 0;
    int n;

    while ((n = Interlocked.Increment(ref nextNumber)) &lt; MAX)
    {
      if (IsPrime(n))
      {
        ++numPrimes;
      }
    }

    Interlocked.Add(ref totalNumPrimes, numPrimes);

    return numPrimes;
  }, $&quot;Thread: {threadNum}&quot;);
}</pre>
<p>The results:</p>
<pre>Thread: 3
Number of primes is : 10446
Total seconds = 13.2079996
Thread: 2
Number of primes is : 10378
Total seconds = 13.2079996
Thread: 0
Number of primes is : 10437
Total seconds = 13.2079996
Thread: 1
Number of primes is : 10277
Total seconds = 13.2079996
Threaded get next work item brute force:
Number of primes is : 41538
Total seconds = 13.2079996</pre>
<p>Notice now that each thread actually runs for exactly the same amount of time 
(that was actually a fluke of that particular test run, they do vary ever so 
slightly.)&nbsp; Also notice we're using our threads efficiently now -- we've 
shaved 6 seconds off the processing time because each core is fully utilized!</p>
<h3>Interlocked and Atomic</h3>
<p>Notice these two lines:</p>
<pre>while ((n = Interlocked.Increment(ref nextNumber)) &lt; MAX)
...
Interlocked.Add(ref totalNumPrimes, numPrimes);</pre>
<p>The way this worker thread requests work is to simply get the next number to 
process -- there's no queuing of work, semaphores, or other complexity.&nbsp; 
However, in order to get the next number and update the total count, each thread 
must ensure that it momentarily blocks the other threads.&nbsp; Otherwise, 
another thread might get exactly the same number or the total might be updated 
simultaneously, resulting in an incorrect count.&nbsp; .NET has an <code>Interlocked</code> 
class (read more
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.interlocked(v=vs.110).aspx">
here</a>) that ensures that the operation is performed atomically, meaning that, 
even if several bytes of data are being changed, the operation is treated as a 
single, synchronous, change.&nbsp; Essentially, it's like writing a <code>lock</code> 
statement around the operation, however it is much more performant because the 
generated IL code (and ultimately the assembly code) can take advantage of CPU 
instructions to exchange the value in memory because you're doing something very 
specific.&nbsp; Using a <code>lock</code> statement, the compiler has no idea what you're 
really doing and can't optimize the code for you.&nbsp; In fact, the methods 
that <code>Interlocked</code> implements closely match the actual Intel CPU instructions<sup>1</sup> that are 
atomic and can therefore be locked.</p>
<h2>More &quot;Modern&quot; Ways of Working with Threads</h2>
<p>Nowadays, the junior programmer probably isn't even instructed regarding the 
<code>Thread</code> class and is instead taught one or more of the various other ways to fire 
off a thread.&nbsp; Learning about the underlying Thread class is however 
important because there are situations when you absolutely want to manage the 
thread yourself rather than letting the .NET framework manage the thread for 
you, particularly threads that interact with .NET's <code>ThreadPool</code> (more on that 
later.)&nbsp; Here are the most common options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>AsParallel - a LINQ extension on an Enumerable</li>
	<li>Task.Run - forcing an asynchronous method</li>
	<li>await - calling an asynchronous method with a continuation</li>
	<li>QueueUserWorkItem&nbsp; - queues work</li>
	<li>BackgroundWorker</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these approaches use the .NET's <code>ThreadPool</code> with the potential 
exception of the &quot;await&quot; syntax in which you have more control over how the task 
is set up.&nbsp; Each also has its nuances regarding:</p>
<ul>
	<li>exception handling</li>
	<li>cancellation tokens</li>
	<li>progress reporting</li>
	<li>best practices with <code>ThreadPool</code></li>
</ul>
<p>One really needs to understand these nuances and how they affect performance 
and error handling.</p>
<h3>AsParallel</h3>
<p><code>AsParallel</code> is one of several query extension methods in the Parallel LINQ (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/introduction-to-plinq">PLINQ</a>) 
library.&nbsp; I'm not going to get into the details of the various methods in 
the <code>ParallelEnumerable</code> class, instead let's look at just <code>AsParallel</code>. </p>
<p>Calling the algorithm:</p>
<pre>DurationOf(AsParallelGetNextWorkItemBruteForce, &quot;AsParallel get next work item brute force:&quot;);</pre>
<p>The implementation:</p>
<pre>static int AsParallelGetNextWorkItemBruteForce()
{
  int totalNumPrimes = 0;

  var nums = Enumerable.Range(2, MAX);
  nums.AsParallel().ForAll(n =&gt;
  {
    if (IsPrime(n))
    {
      Interlocked.Increment(ref totalNumPrimes);
    }
  });

  return totalNumPrimes;
}</pre>
<p>Note the code&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>nums.AsParallel().ForAll</code>, which 
attempts, for each item in the enumerable, to execute in parallel the action 
action declared in <code>ForAll.</code></p>
<p>The results (don't compare this with the results above, currently I'm on a VM 
that seems to run faster than my laptop natively):</p>
<pre>AsParallel get next work item brute force:
Number of primes is : 41538
Total seconds = 11.7537395</pre>
<p>Compare with the balanced brute force thread timing:</p>
<pre>Thread: 1
Number of primes is : 10326
Total seconds = 11.7124344
Thread: 2
Number of primes is : 10517
Total seconds = 11.7124344
Thread: 0
Number of primes is : 10502
Total seconds = 11.7124344
Thread: 3
Number of primes is : 10193
Total seconds = 11.7134212
Threaded get next work item brute force:
Number of primes is : 41538
Total seconds = 11.7304613</pre>
<p>So that's neat -- we timing is essentially identical.</p>
<h3>Task.Run</h3>
<p><code>Task.Run</code> is one of the ways to implement a task-based 
asynchronous pattern<sup>3</sup> (TAP) quickly to create a worker thread.&nbsp; This is 
an example of what is called a &quot;compute-bound&quot; task, meaning that the task is 
performed by the CPU rather than the program waiting for a device (like a 
fingerprint reader) or connection (to a database, for example) to return a 
result.&nbsp; It's important to understand the difference between compute-bound io-bound tasks<sup>2</sup>, particularly with regards to threads managed by the 
ThreadPool, which should not block for large periods of time</p>
<p>Calling the algorithm:</p>
<pre>DurationOf(TaskRunGetNextWorkItemBruteForce, &quot;Task.Run get next work item brute force:&quot;);</pre>
<p>The implementation:</p>
<pre>static int TaskRunGetNextWorkItemBruteForce()
{
  int numProcs = Environment.ProcessorCount;
  totalNumPrimes = 0;
  nextNumber = 1;
  List&lt;Task&gt; tasks = new List&lt;Task&gt;();

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; numProcs; i++)
  {
    var task = Task.Run(() =&gt; NextWorkItemBruteForceThread(i));
    tasks.Add(task);
  }

  Task.WaitAll(tasks.ToArray());

  return totalNumPrimes;
}</pre>
<p>Notice the <code>Task.WaitAll</code>, which is like&nbsp; thread <code>Join</code> -- the current 
thread blocks until all tasks are complete.&nbsp; As with <code>Join</code>, use with 
caution!&nbsp; Also notice that we can call the same method, <code>NextWorkItemBruteForceThread(i)</code>, that performs the 
computation as we do in the balanced brute force thread setup routine.</p>
<p>The results (again don't compare with the previous results, I'm running on a 
different machine at the moment) - these compare quite well with <code>AsParallel</code> and 
the balanced brute force algorithm.</p>
